"""
Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating quartiles. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given an array, , of  integers, calculate the respective first quartile (), second quartile (), and third quartile (). It is guaranteed that , , and  are integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

Constraints

, where  is the  element of the array.
Output Format

Print  lines of output in the following order:

The first line should be the value of .
The second line should be the value of .
The third line should be the value of .
Sample Input

93 7 8 5 12 14 21 13 18
Sample Output

61216
Explanation

. When we sort the elements in non-decreasing order, we get . It's easy to see that .

As there are an odd number of data points, we do not include the median (the central value in the ordered list) in either half:

Lower half (L): 3, 5, 7, 8

Upper half (U): 13, 14, 18, 21

Now, we find the quartiles:

 is the . So, .
 is the . So, .
 is the . So, .

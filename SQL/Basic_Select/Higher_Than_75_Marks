For MS SQL Server, you can use RIGHT function like;

SELECT NAME FROM STUDENTS WHERE MARKS > 75 ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME, 3), ID ASC;

SQL Server

select name
from students 
where marks>75
order by substring(name,len(name)-2, 3) , id asc;
"""
//-2 means the substring starts from the third last character of the city name //3 means the length of the substring is 3.
